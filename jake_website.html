    <main>
        <p>I am a PhD student at UT Austin and a memeber of the <a href="https://chaos.utexas.edu/">Center for Nonlinear Dynamics</a> in the <a href="https://physics.utexas.edu/">Department of Physics</a>. As part of the <a href="https://alv.ac/alab.html">Alvarado Lab</a>, I build simple robots to help uncover and understand the underlying physical design principles of biological systems. <p>
        <p>Entering grad school, I had very limited robotics knowledge and basically had to 'figure-it-out' as I went. One thing I've notice in trying to build simple robots is that, sure there's material out there, but not many well written, complete top-to-bottom tutorials. In addition to providing my professional experience here, I want to address this gap and share complete tutorials on how to build simple machines. I plan to include lists of necessary hardware, links to code, wiring diagrams, and theory and explanation where I can offer it.</p>
